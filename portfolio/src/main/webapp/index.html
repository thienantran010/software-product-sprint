            <h1>Hey! I'm <span>Thienan Tran</span>.</h1>
            <p>I'm currently a third-year computer science major at 
                Boston University. I've just started to dip my feet into
                web development and I'm currently loving it. Right now
                I'm interested in Web Animations API and Scroll Timeline API
                to bring brilliant effects to my work.</p>

                <li>
                    <span>OCaml Interpreter</span>
                    <p>A CS320 class project, the interpeter parsed through a string of commands in a stack language to
                        generate commands in a term language. These commands were then executed. Also could translate
                        commands in term language to stack language.

                <li>
                    <span>Volunteer Teacher's Aide</span>
                    <p>I ensured that summer school at Cathedral Academy at Pompei (CAP) was a smooth experience for everyone involved. I troubleshooted technical issues for the teachers, 
                        assisted students with their tasks, and ran general errands like printing papers.

                    <span>Maintenance Worker</span>
                    <p>I used to work inside CAP. I washed the floors, scraped tape off the walls, and relocated heavy furniture and 
                        books. Nowadays, I work outside, cleaning up the trash on school and parish grounds.</p>

                    <span>Food Service Worker</span>
                    <p>I used to work in Boston University's dining hall. I prepared meals and served them to the hundreds of 
                        students who visited each day.  </p>

                    <span>Office Assistant</span>
                    <p>During the school year, I work in Boston University's Development and Alumni Relations office.
                        I answer emails, phone calls, and questions about events, alumni, and services. I also build 
                        event pages and maintain the alumni database.</p>
