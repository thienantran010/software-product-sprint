            <p class="receive bio hide">I'm a computer science major entering my third year at Boston University. I like reading scary stories,
                watching movie recaps, and playing mobile games. I get most of my dopamine from TikTok. But my gains?
                I get those at the gym. If you asked me what I was listening to on street I would say Tate McRae. I just 
                got started in web development and I really like it so far. My goal right now is to bring flashy, modern animations
                and effects to my sites.

                    <p>A CS320 class project, the interpeter parsed through a string of commands in a stack language to
                        generate commands in a term language. These commands were then executed. Also could translate
                        commands in term language to stack language.

                    <span>Volunteer Teacher's Aide</span>
                    <p>I ensured that summer school at Cathedral Academy at Pompei (CAP) was a smooth experience for everyone involved. I troubleshooted technical issues for the teachers, 
                        assisted students with their tasks, and ran general errands like printing papers.

                    <p>I used to work inside CAP. I washed the floors, scraped tape off the walls, and relocated heavy furniture and 
                        books. Nowadays, I work outside, cleaning up the trash on school and parish grounds.</p>

                    <p>I used to work in Boston University's dining hall. I prepared meals and served them to the hundreds of

                        I answer emails, phone calls, and questions about events, alumni, and services. I also build 
                        event pages and maintain the alumni database.</p>
